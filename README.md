# 📱 Mobile Task Manager – Assignment 13

This repository contains the implementation for **Assignment 13** of the Task Manager App project.

## 🎯 Assignment Goal

Perform the final polishing of the App. Use Material3 and modernize the User Interface with proper theming, better form UX and localization. 

## ✅ Implemented Features

- Created a custom Theme that uses custom colors (generated by Material Theme Builder using #6CACE4 as a source color) and typography styles for some texts, mostly for titles. Also refactored some view attributes into styles.
- Refactored all layout files to use Material UI components, including MaterialToolbar, FloatingActionButton,MaterialCardView and MaterialDatePicker.
- Refactored TaskDetailFragment and TaskFormFragment to be ModalBottomSheets.
- Greatly improved the UI in TaskDetailFragment and TaskFormFragment, including the use of a date picker in the form.
- Modified navgraph.xml, TaskDetailFragment and TaskFormFragment are now dialogs, and both are dismissed when navigating to the other to prevent stacking dialogs. This means TaskForm onPause/onResume have been slightly modified to preserve task saving logic.
- Refactored fragment navigation.
- Refactored MainActivity.kt because the activity´s Toolbar no longer has a menu. The menu options are now hosted by the FloatingActionButton on TaskList, and the Toolbars on the detail & form bottom sheets.
- There is now a dimens.xml to hold all dimensions used in layouts/styles.
- Added an improved App icon.
- Replaced Toast with Snackbar.
- Implemented Spanish localization.

## 🚧 Known Issues

- No known issues.

## 📝 Notes

- Form fields with validation are now validated after the value is changed, not only when submitting.
- Colors used in BindingAdapters now hve an extra reference in colors.xml to not directly relate a category/dueDate color with a color (example, urgent tasks now use category_urgent color instead of red).
- Both light and dark mode are supported.
- Slightly refactored date extension functions to make them easier to use (coul be still better).
- Most of the files had minor changes for documentation.
- Updated the APK.

### 📝 IMPORTANT

CrudCrud API only allows 24h of service OR up to 100 operations. To reset the API, you must obtain a new API key from CrudCrud and change the stored API key in API.xml file.
